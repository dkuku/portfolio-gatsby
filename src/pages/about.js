                    I have 10+ years of experience working as a Multi Skilled Maintenance Engineer.
                   I really like to solve problems, find bugs and improvements.
                   The problem is that I don't feel that I'm learning new things anymore.
                   That's why I decided to change my career path to something different.
                   Something where I have some small experience but there's still a lot to learn.
                   On this website, you can find some of the projects that I've done when learning development.
              Also on my <a href='https://github.com/dkuku/' target='blank'>github</a>
                    page you can check some smaller projects done durning different online courses.
                    I'm mainly focused on react, I think it's a really good library and my studies were focused on React and Ruby on Rails.
                    On the backend I've done some projects using node with express and meteor.

                    Beside these projects, I've also a lot of experience with the Linux operating system.
                    I'm using Linux for the last 15 years or more.
                    I have lots of experience with Debian/Ubuntu based distros, Gentoo Linux, openWRT/LEDE and lately with Arch Linux.
                   Another of my hobbies is electronics and simple programmes for embedded systems like Arduinos and similar boards.
