I really like to solve problems, find bugs and\n            improvements. The problem is that I don't feel that I'm learning new\n            things anymore. That's why I decided to change my career path to\n            something different. Something where I have some small experience\n            but there's still a lot to learn. On this website, you can find some\n            of the projects that I've done when learning development. Also on my{' '}\n            <a href=\"https://github.com/dkuku/\" target=\"blank\">\n              github\n            </a>\n            page you can check some smaller projects done durning different\n            online courses. I'm mainly focused on react, I think it's a really\n            good library and my studies were focused on React and Ruby on Rails.\n            On the backend I've done some projects using node with express and\n            meteor.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <Image\n              src=\"https://www.linuxcounter.net/cert/282399.png\"\n              floated=\"left\"\n            />\n            Beside these projects, I've also a lot of experience with the Linux\n            operating system. I'm using Linux for the last 15 years or more. I\n            have lots of experience with Debian/Ubuntu based distros, Gentoo\n            Linux, openWRT/LEDE and lately with Arch Linux. Another of my\n            hobbies is electronics and simple programmes for embedded systems\n            like Arduinos and similar boards.\n          </p>\n        </Container>\n      </Segment>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { Segment, Image, Header } from 'semantic-ui-react'\n\nexport default class MyHeading extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const front = this.props.frontPage\n    return (\n      <Segment\n        inverted={front}\n        textAlign=\"center\"\n        style={{ height: '100%', padding: '1em 0em' }}\n        vertical\n      >\n        <Image\n          src=\"images/daniel-sq.jpg\"\n          size={front ?
